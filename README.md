# Aravind Vengarai

I'm a recent graduate from the Georgia Institute of Technology, where I've honed my skills in Computer Science to embark on a journey as a Software Engineer. Here, you'll find a showcase of my projects, research, and contributions that paint a picture of my journey and expertise.

## Education

**Georgia Institute of Technology** - Atlanta, GA  
M.S. in Computer Science, 3.85/4.00 - Highest Honors (August 2019 – December 2023)  
B.S. in Computer Science, 3.84/4.00 - Highest Honors (August 2019 – December 2023)

## Work Experience

**Software Engineering Intern, Lumen Technologies** - Monroe, LA (May 2023 – Aug 2023)  
- Retooled the automation that refreshes the production support environment using GitHub actions, reducing the refresh time from 3 hrs to 5 minutes, and saving over $8000 per year.  
- Spearheaded the initiative to run UI automation tests by integrating Playwright with Testkube, resulting in a 70% reduction in test creation effort and increased confidence in build quality.  
- Developed UI feature that suspends/resumes deployments so an environment stays consistent during demos.

**Software Engineering Intern, NCR Corporation** - Atlanta, GA (May 2022 – Aug 2022)  
- Built Go-based REST APIs to support displaying of real-time analytics for a POS application built with BigQuery and MongoDB accessed by about 75% of all user flows interacting with the UI.  
- Implemented an Apache Beam dataflow pipeline for transferring transaction logs as Pub-Sub messages to a Big Query database, decreasing query times by 10x, and reducing backend service processing load.  
- Streamlined deployments by automating the compilation of dataflow templates to GCP storage buckets.

**Software Engineering Intern, Bashpole Software, Inc.** - North Webster, IN (May 2021 – July 2021)  
- Constructed a full-stack application using JSP to generate optimal landing pages for Bashpole's clients, improving user engagement and conversion rates for 1000s of viewers monthly.  
- Reduced intern onboarding period by 67% by refactoring landing page projects into a single Maven project.

**Teaching Assistant, College of Computing** - Georgia Tech (January 2021 – December 2023)  
- Taught data structures and algorithms to 400+ 1st and 2nd-year students for 2 semesters, and a database systems course to 200+ seniors and graduate students for 4 semesters.

## Research

**Undergraduate Research Assistant, College of Computing** - Georgia Tech (December 2020 – May 2021)  
- Developed an Android app used by 11 Emory University doctors, as part of an NSF funded research project, to track PTSD patients’ progress through exposure therapy, improving treatment efficacy.  
- Integrated 4 background services collecting app usage, geolocation, body movement, and audio data, enabling data-driven treatment adjustments for better patient outcomes.
