## Work Experience

**Software Engineering Intern, Lumen Technologies** - Monroe, LA (May 2023 – Aug 2023)  
- Retooled the automation that refreshes the production support environment using GitHub actions, reducing the refresh time from 3 hrs to 5 minutes, and saving over $8000 per year.  
- Spearheaded the initiative to run UI automation tests by integrating Playwright with Testkube, resulting in a 70% reduction in test creation effort and increased confidence in build quality.  
- Developed UI feature that suspends/resumes deployments so an environment stays consistent during demos.

**Software Engineering Intern, NCR Corporation** - Atlanta, GA (May 2022 – Aug 2022)  
- Built Go-based REST APIs to support displaying of real-time analytics for a POS application built with BigQuery and MongoDB accessed by about 75% of all user flows interacting with the UI.  
- Implemented an Apache Beam dataflow pipeline for transferring transaction logs as Pub-Sub messages to a Big Query database, decreasing query times by 10x, and reducing backend service processing load.  
- Streamlined deployments by automating the compilation of dataflow templates to GCP storage buckets.

**Software Engineering Intern, Bashpole Software, Inc.** - North Webster, IN (May 2021 – July 2021)  
- Constructed a full-stack application using JSP to generate optimal landing pages for Bashpole's clients, improving user engagement and conversion rates for 1000s of viewers monthly.  
- Reduced intern onboarding period by 67% by refactoring landing page projects into a single Maven project.

**Teaching Assistant, College of Computing** - Georgia Tech (January 2021 – December 2023)  
- Taught data structures and algorithms to 400+ 1st and 2nd-year students for 2 semesters, and a database systems course to 200+ seniors and graduate students for 4 semesters.

## Research

**Undergraduate Research Assistant, College of Computing** - Georgia Tech (December 2020 – May 2021)  
- Developed an Android app used by 11 Emory University doctors, as part of an NSF funded research project, to track PTSD patients’ progress through exposure therapy, improving treatment efficacy.  
- Integrated 4 background services collecting app usage, geolocation, body movement, and audio data, enabling data-driven treatment adjustments for better patient outcomes.

## Projects


# BuzzEx - Marketplace Delivery App

**Objective:** To resolve delivery arrangement challenges in online marketplaces like Facebook Marketplace and Craigslist by developing a React Native app integrating a delivery function, enhancing user experience and sales efficiency.

- **[Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAAWD3mCmRQ) | [GitHub](https://github.com/AravindVengarai/buzzEx)**
- **Technology Stack:** React Native for cross-platform app development, Node.js for the backend, and Firestore for real-time database functionalities.

# NBA Playoff Predictor

**Overview:** Advanced statistical models and machine learning techniques were employed to forecast NBA playoffs and championship outcomes, using mid-season performance data and a comprehensive dataset of NBA Box Scores.

- **[GitHub](https://kimayamcolaco.github.io/CS7641-Team-25/)**
- **Results:** The GMM model successfully predicted 93.75% of the playoff teams from the 2020-2021 NBA season, and the SVM model achieved an accuracy of approximately 69.76% in predicting outcomes, which increased to 83% with further tuning.
- **Methods:** Utilized Principal Component Analysis and Support Vector Machines for predictive accuracy, employing unsupervised and supervised learning techniques.
